# ChinLabQMS

This is the repo to organize the code used by QMS Lab in Chin group at the University of Chicago.

## [MATLAB-Andor](https://github.com/ChinLabQMS/MATLAB-Andor)
Image acquisition and analysis framework developed in MATLAB, with functionality to process fluorescence images of single atoms.

## [Side-Image-Analysis](https://github.com/ChinLabQMS/Side-Image-Analysis)
Image analysis code to read and process saved CSV files from LabVIEW control programs, with functionality to process absorption images of atomic samples.

## [DMD-pattern-generator](https://github.com/ChinLabQMS/DMD-pattern-generator)
Python code to generate patterns for calibrating DMD, and pack the patterns to `bmp` files.

## [DMD-SDL](https://github.com/ChinLabQMS/DMD-SDL.git)
C program to create opaque window to stream static/dynamic patterns on a DMD for projecting programmable optical potential on cold atoms.

## [Novatech-frequency-synthesizer](https://github.com/ChinLabQMS/Novatech-frequency-synthesizer)
Short notebook and simple functions to generate frequency sweep curves to transport atoms over a distance.
